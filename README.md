# 🧙‍♂️ CTD — Code The Dream

## 🏰 Purpose

This repository exists because my dream doesn't clock out — I built it to keep my schoolwork alive while I'm moving, grinding, living. Whether I'm on a laptop, library PC, or tapped in from my phone, this is where the dream follows me.

And if you're staff — like Noah or my mentors — welcome in. You're always invited to peek into my castle-in-progress.

## 🔍 Features

- 📦 Mobile access to my JavaScript, HTML, and CSS coursework
- 🔄 Ability to reflect, revise, and build on the go
- 🤝 Shared space for mentors and teachers to observe, guide, or check in
- 🧠 Optional window into other students' logic, for collaborative learning

## ✨ Lessons Learned

This isn’t about showing off — it’s about showing up.

Working with this repo, I’ve gained insight into how others think and solve. The real magic isn’t just the code — it’s the perspective. Every “wrong” answer I read gives me a better right one.

## ❌ Installation

This isn’t a clone-and-go kind of thing. It’s *mine*.  
If you’re here, it’s to see — not to steal.  
So there’s no install guide, just insight.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

To the people who didn’t just teach me how to code, but reminded me *why* to code:

- Aaliyah -Peer
- Olga - Peer
- Josiah — my mentor and motivator  
- Noah — keeping me sharp and pushing for better  
- Ms. Susie — all grace and guidance

Thank you for your kindness, your belief, and your example. I want to be better because you already showed me what better looks like.

## 🛠️ The Mission

CTD isn’t a project. It’s a proof of life.

It’s the flag I plant wherever I go — a reminder that I’m not just doing assignments.  
I’m building a kingdom. A foundation.  
A place where the dream stays alive no matter where I stand.

Stay tuned. I’m only getting started.
